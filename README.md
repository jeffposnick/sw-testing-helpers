This Repo is largely to share code across several libraries being developed
by the Web DevRel team.

At the moment this serves as an example project of how to set things up
but will also make certain files available that can be required in and used
within unit tests.

## NPM Scripts

You can view the default automated tests with the following npm scripts.

Run the automated tests:

    npm run test

## Docs

You can [find some docs here](http://googlechrome.github.io/sw-testing-helpers/)
but they are far from complete.

Any and all help welcome with this grab bag of stuff.
